## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing sales data to uncover trends, customer behavior, and key insights about sales performance. The dataset provides detailed information about product orders, including order quantities, prices, dates, and customer locations. It also includes derived attributes like month, sales, city, and purchase hour for deeper analysis.  

The primary goals of the project are:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Visualizing insights to identify trends and customer preferences.
